Smart Coin Machine PCB (v2.1)

![Smart Coin PCB Version 2 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca069f5e-9c23-4e36-bfbb-2b26aa98db8c)

This project is a custom PCB for smart coin and bill acceptor machines, designed to simplify wiring, assembly, and integration with GSM modules, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.

✨ Features

Plug & Play Wiring

Just connect +12V DC input via screw terminals.

Direct connections for coin acceptor, bill acceptor, buzzer, and status LEDs.

GSM Module Support

Compatible with SIM800L and SIM800C.

On-board relay to enable/disable GSM module.

Reset GSM via dedicated relay (Arduino Pin 7).

Built-in DC-DC step-down regulator (LM2596S) provides stable +4V supply for GSM.

Relays & Control

Coin Enable Relay → controlled by Raspberry Pi (Pin 17).

GSM Enable Relay → power cycle or disable GSM when needed.

Power Loss Relay → detect and respond to AC mains failures.

Indicators & Status LEDs

Arduino Pin 8 → Blue LED status output.

Raspberry Pi Pin 27 → Green LED status output.

GSM status LED indicators (Orange).

220VAC Detection

Input and output connectors for 220VAC detection sensor.

Useful for monitoring AC mains availability.
